Gene Legacy is a 2D roguelike game made by a group of 6 developers in 48 hours for the [Winter 2024 UQAC's WonderJam](https://itch.io/jam/wonderjam-uqac-h24).<br>
It's inspired by the game [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/).<br>
The theme of the jam was "Genetics" and we got "Versus" and "Merge" as constraints. <br>
You can play the game [here](https://okane-e.itch.io/gene-legacy)!

## The team

We were a team of 6 students, 5 learning video game development and 1 learning cybersecurity, all coming from UQAC, and it was our first game jam!<br>
My role in the team was to be a game designer and programmer, level designer, and project manager.

## The development
We used the first day to brainstorm in a Game Design Document (GDD) and come up with a game idea that would fit the theme and constraints. With our constraints, we decided to make a 2D roguelike game using [Unity](https://unity.com) where you would merge genes to get new abilities and fight against monsters in an infinite set of rooms. <br>

For our constraints, we decided to make a Player vs Monsters/Boss game where you would be able to merge genes to get new abilities in order to fight against stronger monsters. <br>
For the theme (Genetics), we had the idea of hereditary genes that would be passed down to the next generation of players. <br>
We didn't have any artists in our team, so we used free assets from itch.io called [Dungeon Tileset II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii) by [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io). <br>

Sadly, because of IRL problems, we couldn't finish the game like we wanted to. We had to cut some features and the game was a bit buggy. We also weren't able to add the "Genetics" part of the game, so the game was kind of off-theme. <br>
Even with all of that, we were still proud of what we accomplished in 48 hours and we had a lot of fun making the game! <br>

## The game

The game is a 2D roguelike game where you play as a character that has to fight against monsters in an infinite set of rooms. <br>
Because we weren't able to add the "Genetics", the gene system wasn't implemented in the game. We also neither had finished the game loop, so the game was more like a "run to the next room" where you would have to fight against monsters, even if they were implemented. <br>

## Looking back

I learned a lot during this jam, like how tilemaps work in Unity, how to make 2D hitboxes and how to fix bugs.

Unfortunately, the IRL problems weren't expected, we didn't have a backup plan for this because we scaled the project down to fit the 48 hours time frame with our team, knowing the experience we had. <br>
Even if we didn't finish the game like we wanted to, we were still proud of what we accomplished in 48 hours for our first game jam. We had a lot of fun making the game and we learned a lot from it.

It definitely was a great experience and I really want to do other game jams in the future! <br>

## Screenshots
Unfortunately, the original repository is in private, and I can't make a public fork so I can only show you the screenshots of the game.

Gene Legacy is a 2D roguelike game made by a group of 6 developers in 48 hours for the [Winter 2024 UQAC's WonderJam](https://itch.io/jam/wonderjam-uqac-h24).<br>
It's inspired by the game [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/).<br>
The theme of the jam was "Genetics" and we got "Versus" and "Merge" as constraints. <br>
You can play the game [here](https://okane-e.itch.io/gene-legacy)!

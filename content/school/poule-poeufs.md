Poule Poeufs is a restyled version of the classic game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), where the player controls a chicken instead of a snake. The goal is to collect as many eggs as possible without hitting the walls or the chicks following the player. The game was developed in [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine-5) using [Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine), in a team of 5 people, three artists and two programmers. <br>
This was made in the context of the course "Making a Video Game" ([8GIF185](https://programmes.uqac.ca/8GIF185) *The page is in French*).

## Retrospective
I was in charge of the snake body, the menus (main menu, credits menu, pause & game over menu) and the score system. I also added the sound effects made using [sfxr](https://pro.sfxr.me).

It was my first game where I collaborated with artists, it was a great experience to work with them. Even though the game is simple, it was a good opportunity to learn how to work with a team composed of different roles. I learned a lot about communication and how to work with artists. 

## Features
Menus:
- Main menu
- Credits menu
- Pause menu
- Game over menu

Score system:
- The score is displayed on the screen during the game
- The score is saved and displayed on the game over screen
